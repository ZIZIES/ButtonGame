This is the Official readme file for the button game.

This game is very simple.

When you click on "Add 1 Point" it adds one point.

When you click on "add 2 Points" it adds 2 points, as you would expect.

But, there is a settings GUI.

To access this settings gui that has the option to...

Edit Your Score [WORKING]

Change Display Color [WORKING]

Toggle Dark Mode [BROKEN]

Restart Game [WORKING]

FYI Restart Game Sets Your Score To 0 It Does Not Reboot Your Game.

To access this settings GUI, click on button one once, then click on button 2 twice, and then click on button one again.

This will open a settings GUI with the options listed above.

I hope you enjoy the game and thank you for reading.
